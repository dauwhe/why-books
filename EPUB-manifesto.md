# “Don’t Break the Web” and the Future of EPUB

It all started with a rant to some of my #eprdctn friends (who are my real-life friends too; I love this community):

```
11:27 dauwhe: I've been thinking about "don't break the web" and epub
11:27 dauwhe: browsers have to support every feature forever, more or less
11:27 dauwhe: even the mistakes
11:27 dauwhe: if even one in ten thousand web sites uses something, it won't be removed
11:30 dauwhe: is epub in the same situation? I think 3.x is. As much was we want to fix our mistakes, we can't.
11:31 dauwhe: and people see no value in fixing mistakes. 3.1 is better in every way than 3.0.1, but nobody cares.
11:31 dauwhe: does 3.1 allow new kinds of books? no.
11:31 dauwhe: does 3.1 guarantee that you can use script now? no.
11:31 dauwhe: so where's the incentive to switch?
11:32 dauwhe: Even with EPUB4 or WP or PWP, how can we make it compelling enough for people to want to use them?
11:32 dauwhe: James Patterson works in OEB 1.0. Everything since has been minor details.
```
Why was I thinking about this? Late last year, work began quietly on a proposal to undo some of the changes in EPUB 3.1, create a new EPUB 3.0.2 spec, and then abandon EPUB 3.1. The stated motivation was for EPUB 3.0.2 to be entirely backward-compatible with EPUB 3.0.1: all existing EPUB 3.0.1 files would automatically be valid EPUB 3.0.2s. I believe one of the  unstated motivations was for existing files to be automatically compatible with the “newest” version of EPUB, without having to make any changes (especially to the `package` version attribute).

This bothered me, both rejecting the good work in EPUB 3.1, and the idea of going backwards in version. But there were good arguments that everyone was doing the right thing. EPUB 3.1 made sense because we were removing features which hardly anyone used, and weren’t well supported. Did any of you use `bindings`? But it also makes sense not to make old content invalid. So who’s right? What should we do? Can we make EPUB better without breaking anything? 

## Mistakes were made


Consider this HTML fragment:

```html
<font color=red>hello</font>
```

Firefox 57.0.4, released last week, knows exactly what to do with this markup, even though the `font` element was deprecated twenty years ago, and removed entirely four years ago. The text is indeed red. *On the web, the old and the new coexist, if uneasily.*

`font` was a mistake. People realized that, and specs changed. But why does `font` still work? Because of one rule: **don’t break the web**. If even three in ten thousand web sites use a feature, and removing a feature might render those sites unreadable, browsers won’t remove it. The web has to be careful, because mistakes are permanent. 


## The slow pace of EPUB


Twenty years into the age of ebooks, our community is trying to figure out what to do with our mistakes. But we don’t even agree on what our mistakes are, let alone what to do about them. Was EPUB 3.1 a mistake? Was `ncx`? Was `epub:switch`? At least we’re finally talking seriously about backward compatibility, about how to “manage” change.

We work in publishing because we love books. We work with ebooks because we’re both idealists and gluttons for punishment. We are full of frustration with the present and hope for the future. We want things to be better; we want change; we need change.

But does anyone else want change? Laura Brady wrote an article here on the [slow adoption of EPUB 3](http://epubsecrets.com/on-the-slow-adoption-of-epub-3.php) just last month; the very same EPUB 3 which became an official recommendation in October of 2011. After more than six years of EPUB 3, EPUB 2 is alive and well. Even my employer, one of the largest publishers in the world, makes EPUB 3s which are as close to EPUB 2 as possible. The `ncx` refuses to die.

There are two problems. First, EPUB 2 is often *good enough*. Most books are better without video. It’s hard to use some new HTML5 features due to poor implementations in older reading systems. Many of the benefits of better accessibility are more theoretical than real right now—how many reading systems do useful things with `epub:type`, other than cute pop-up footnotes?

Second, the lines between versions of EPUB are often blurred. Many of us remember fixed-layout EPUB 2, or EPUB 2 with audio. Our EPUB 3 files include the dreaded `ncx`. Reading system support is far more variable than the specifications are. Most EPUB 3.0.1 files are indistinguishable from EPUB 3.0 files.

## Moving Forward

The question remains: how do we move forward? Perhaps we can learn something from the web, and make old and new coexist more easily. But first, we need to be aware of how different EPUB-Land is from Web World:


1. The EPUB ecosystem depends on formal validation, unlike the web. One interesting aspect of this is that many formally invalid EPUBs actually work. Most common reading systems already support `package version="3.1"`. You can use regular HTML without the "X" in some places. And, of course, we all know about the millions valid EPUBs which don’t work.

2. There are many more EPUB Reading Systems than browsers, making research, testing, and QA that much harder, and sometimes impossible.

3. Browsers are well-tested and constantly upgraded.

4. EPUBs are sold and displayed by someone else. Web sites don’t have intermediaries rewriting their content, injecting scripts, and generally changing their behavior randomly. 

But, acknowledging all those differences, what should we do?


### 1. Find the EPUB that *is*, not the EPUB we want.

Before we change EPUB any more, we need to find out what is supported today. EPUB creators are less interested in what *should* work than in what *does* work. Let’s create a version of EPUB that is thoroughly tested, that includes **only** features that are widely implemented, that is fact instead of fiction.

To do this we need tests, and we need lots of reading systems that pass the tests. **What is the interoperable core of EPUB; what features can be trusted everywhere?** Let’s find out.

### 2. More nuanced validation.

EPUBCheck is the piller of our community, the center of our workflows, the true arbiter of what EPUB is and what EPUB isn’t. But this sophisticated tool is too often used in a simplistic way. `No errors or warnings` is good; literally anything else is bad. 

We’re afraid to allow EPUBCheck to provide more information by default. Even the specs say that EPUB creators should be alerted if an EPUB contains deprecated features. But the spec also says that alert should be less severe than an error or warning, and so no one ever sees the alert.

What would happen if we used EPUBCheck differently? Instead of telling EPUBCheck that I’m an EPUB 3, what if EPUBCheck recognized what features I actually used, and then described my level of compatibility? Most of our EPUB3s work as EPUB 2. Why not say so? What we’re really checking for is a match between the content and the reading system.

We’ve also talked about the possibility of a `strict` mode for EPUBCheck, where all obsolete or deprecated features would be forbidden. And there are errors of structure—is the package invalid in the XML sense?—and errors of features—content MathML isn’t part of the spec. Is there value in recognizing that an EPUB is structurally well-formed, even though it may include unrecognized features?

### 3. Trust HTML

One of the strengths of HTML is that it knows how to handle almost anything. Consider this fragment:

```html
<epub-secrets>
  <h-7 style="color: red;">Editors</h-7>
  <simple-list>
    <simple-list-item>Laura Brady</simple-list-item>
  </simple-list>
</epub-secrets>
```

This works perfectly well in my browser. HTML has a rule for unknown elements: ignore them, but process their children. This is what makes it possible for past and future to co-exist. I could actually implement what you see above using HTML custom elements. So it might be magical in a cutting-edge browser, but still readable in a tech-challenged executive’s old copy of Internet Explorer.

Eventually, EPUB should get out of the business of policing HTML and CSS—those languages are both very robust, and have well-defined error handling. Does your EPUB contain `epub:switch`? No problem—web engines, even if they don’t understand that element, won’t crash. They know how to fail gracefully. 

### 4. Make change compelling

Creating EPUB 3.2, or 3.0.2, is not going to make more people adopt a new version. The cost is too high; the benefits too small or too uncertain. Even if you think you can just run a script to update something small, do you really want to risk touching every single book you’ve ever published? Do you want to redo expensive QA?

If we want people to upgrade, we need to create something worth upgrading to. I would love it if script worked everywhere, if I had persistent local storage, if I could have images that filled the reader’s screen. 

### 5. Build, then specify

Yes, let’s imagine and then create great new features. But let’s make sure they work first, that people want them, that they’re well designed, that reading systems can support them. EPUB has been a field where dreams are crushed—we built it, and they didn’t come. The web community learned a long time ago that a specification isn’t real until it’s implemented, and you can’t discover all the problems without using it. We must learn this lesson, and **require multiple interoperable implementations before specifications are final**. 

EPUB *has* evolved, but largely in ways we don’t recognize. CSS Flexbox now works in iBooks, because the underlying browser engine was updated. How can our specs recognize when things like that happen? The state of the art will evolve.
